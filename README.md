# Regression Model with Keras (Deep Learning)
In this project, I have build a regression model using the deep learning Keras library, and then  experimented with increasing the number of training epochs and changing number of hidden layers and see how changing these parameters impacts the performance of the model.

# Details :
Part A -> 
        Mean of all 50 mean squared errors is :  456.2614
        Standard Deviation of all 50 mean squared error is :  549.0125

Part B ->
        Mean of all 50 mean squared errors is :  392.9822
        Standard Deviation of all 50 mean squared error is :  125.6754

Part C ->
        Mean of all 50 mean squared errors is :  165.5089
        Standard Deviation of all 50 mean squared error is :  15.6582

Part D ->
        Mean of all 50 mean squared errors is :  126.4122
        Standard Deviation of all 50 mean squared error is :  19.7633
